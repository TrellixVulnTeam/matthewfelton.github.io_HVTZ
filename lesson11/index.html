        <h2>March Madness is Coming</h2>
        <h4>By Adam Augustyn</h4>
        <img class="topl" src="images/articlehome.jpg" alt="festival">
        <p>The first men’s tournament was held in 1939, but it was overshadowed for 
            most of the first two decades of its existence by the National 
            Invitation Tournament (NIT), which was considered more prestigious 
            and usually featured the best teams in the country. The NCAA tournament 
            gradually began to draw the top teams and more television revenue, and, 
            by the time the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), began its 
            record run of seven consecutive titles in 1967, the tournament was firmly 
            established as the premier college basketball postseason championship series 
            in the United States. The size of the tournament field increased incrementally 
            from 8 teams in 1939 to 64 teams in 1985. A 65th team and corresponding “play-in game” 
            were added in 2001, when a new conference with an automatically qualifying champion 
            was created and the NCAA did not want to lower the number of high-profile at-large 
            schools it could invite to the tournament. In 2011 the NCAA added three additional 
            opening-round games to the field, bringing the field to 68 teams. The first women’s 
            tournament was 
            a 32-team event held in 1982, and it expanded to its current field of 64 in 1994.</p>
