            <p>Located in north-central Alabama, 15 miles from the Tennessee border, Athens is the
                county seat of Limestone County. Since its founding in 1818, one year before Alabama's
                admittance into the Union, Athens has contributed significantly to shaping the history
                of the state. Home to three Alabama governors and the state's oldest institution of higher
                education, Athens boasts a number of historic buildings and residences. Originally an
                agricultural community, Athens has evolved into a
                major center of technology in North Alabama. Athens has a mayor-council form of government.</p>
            <h3>Demographics</h3>
            <p>The population of Athens, according to 2016 Census estimates, was
                24,461. Of that total, 74.4 percent of respondents identified
                themselves as white, 17.5 percent as African American, 8.8 percent
                Hispanic, 3.1 percent as two or more races, 0.9 percent as Native
                American, 0.7 percent as Asian, and 0.1 percent as Native Hawaiian
                and Other Pacific Islander. The city's median household income was
                $44,920, and the per capita income was $28,865.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>The Athens City School System has four elementary schools, one intermediate school,

            <h3>Events and Places of Interest</h3>
            <p>The Athens area is host to a number of cultural,

                One of the best known yearly events in Athens
                is the Tennessee Valley Old Time Fiddlers Convention,
                which is held at Athens State University every October
                and attracts approximately 15,000 music lovers from across
                the country. 
                Donnell House
                In addition to the weekend of musical competition,
                hundreds of musicians participate in the numerous
                jam sessions conducted across the campus. Another
                event is the Annual Storytelling Festival, spanning
                three days in downtown Athens every October and featuring
                story tellers from across the nation. The Alabama Veterans
                Museum and Archives, located in the former L&N freight depot,
                features displays of memorabilia from the Revolutionary War
                to the present in honor of veterans. A number of structures
                in Athens are listed on the National Register of Historic
                Places, including the Robert Donnell House (1840), Cotton
                Hill (ca. 1828), the Joel Eddins House (ca. 1810), Fort
                Henderson, and the Courthouse Square and State College
                Historic Districts.

                record blue catfish, 111 pounds, was caught in the Wheeler
                reservoir. The city of Athens Parks and Recreation Department
                maintains and manages five city parks, the Athens Recreation
                Center, and the Athens Sportsplex. Every September, Athens
                hosts its annual Grease Fest, in which celebrants dress in
                togas and consume greasy foods such as fried cookies and snack cakes.
